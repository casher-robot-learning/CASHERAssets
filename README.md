# CASHER Assets
In this repository we make available a large portion of the crowdsourced environments for the CASHER project. In `objects` you will find the different objects used in `.glb` format and in `scenes` you will find the full assembled scenes in USDZ format.

If you use these assets for your project please remember to cite us:
